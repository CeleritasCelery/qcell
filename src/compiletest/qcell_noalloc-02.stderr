error[E0382]: use of moved value: `owner1`
  --> src/compiletest/qcell_noalloc-02.rs:10:5
   |
8  |     let mut owner1 = QCellOwnerPinned::new();
   |         ---------- move occurs because `owner1` has type `QCellOwnerPinned`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
9  |     let mut owner2 = owner1;
   |                      ------ value moved here
10 |     pin_mut!(owner1);  // Compile fail
   |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ value used here after move
   |
   = note: this error originates in the macro `pin_mut` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
